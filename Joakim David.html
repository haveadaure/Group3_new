<B>About</B>
<hr color =brown>My personal information is given in the brief paragraph below, as stated in the aforementioned title. I'm Joakim David, and I'm 20 years old. I was born on December, 2003. I am from the Western Highland Province and Tambul Nebilyer District. I last attended Togoba Secondary in Western Highland Province, which is located 5 kilometers south of Mt. Hagen City. I was accepted to Western Pacific University to finish my studies after completing grade 12, and now here I am. I finished the Certificate in Higher Education Foundation Studies (CHEFS) program last year 2022, for which I received a certificate. I was interested in taking an IT class this year 2023, and I decided on Computer Networking because I want to work as a network engineer. I am currently a first-year student studying computer network here at Western Pacific University.
That’s all about myself and thank you for reading.
